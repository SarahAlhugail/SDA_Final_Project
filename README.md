## Business Problem 

>A bank manager worried about the increasing number of churns in the credit card service. In a business, the cost to get a new customer is usually much higher than what it takes to keep an existing one. For this purpose, the main goal will be predicting the highest number of potential churners to provide them better services and Achieve costumerâ€™s satisfaction to turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction.
This is a classic business issue that happens in all industries and I will explore the customer behaviours to get more insights as well as applying the predictive modelling.

## Let see what we have in our data set:

### Dataset and Features
>This dataset consists of 10,127 customers mentioning their age, salary, marital_status, credit card limit, credit card category and more, There are 23 features consisting of 6 objects and the remaining are either integer or float. It is a clean dataset with no null values encountered.


### Data Vistualtion
>For data visualization, we are going to use seaborn plots. Histgram , Scatter , boxplot and finaly heatmap plots usually helps us to understand data easily.

These plots can answer a lot of questions and clarify the data. The actual customer that moved out is 1,627 customers out of 8,500 existing customers (16% attrition). First, Based on gender, almost equal split between males and females.

Another interesting fact, they have significant customers with income less than 40,000,

And there are four product categories but the majority of customers signed up with Blue.!

And based on eduction level the significant customers with graduate degrees.

lastly, Marital status is also closely split between single and married.

Moreover we saw in the previous chart there are four product categories and the majority of customers signed up with Blue. here I want to take a detailed look at the category and the credit limit.

There is a lot of outliers in the Blue category, but it makes sense, and that because most of the consumers are using blue cards so it will be differences in credit limit.
