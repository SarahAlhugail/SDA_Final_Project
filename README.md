## Business Problem 

>A bank manager worried about the increasing number of churns in the credit card service. In a business, the cost to get a new customer is usually much higher than what it takes to keep an existing one. For this purpose, the main goal will be predicting the highest number of potential churners to provide them better services and Achieve costumerâ€™s satisfaction to turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction.
This is a classic business issue that happens in all industries and I will explore the customer behaviours to get more insights as well as applying the predictive modelling.

## Let see what we have in our data set:

### Dataset and Features
>This dataset consists of 10,127 customers mentioning their age, salary, marital_status, credit card limit, credit card category and more, There are 23 features consisting of 6 objects and the remaining are either integer or float. It is a clean dataset with no null values encountered.


### Data Vistualtion
>For data visualization, we are going to use seaborn plots. Histgram , Scatter , boxplot and finaly heatmap plots usually helps us to understand data easily.
